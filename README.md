</p>
<p>A super common task is automating the creation of GitHub objects. One, organziations, isn&#39;t super well documented and kind of hard to find so I&#39;m making a note on how to do it.</p>

<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dxrf.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2021&#x2F;09&#x2F;28&#x2F;gh-copilot-markdown-all-in-one-extension">GitHub Copilot tab-complete not working in markdown files</a> 
</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been with the beta for GitHub Copilot for a while and I recently noticed that the tab-complete stopped working when editing markdown files. I started searching and found a couple GH issues, one of which has a usable workaround.</p>

<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dxrf.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2021&#x2F;09&#x2F;28&#x2F;setting-up-enterprise-runners">Setting up Shared Enterprise Actions</a> 
</p>
<p>I recently had a customer that wanted to set up shared runners in their enterprise but the docs weren&#39;t super clear so I wrote up these steps to make it easier.</p>

<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dxrf.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2021&#x2F;09&#x2F;10&#x2F;mustache-and-jekyllfeed">Consuming Jekyll-feed xml with Node.JS and Mustache templates</a> 
</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been spending some free time sprucing up my GitHub personal readme. One of those tasks was to pull the last 5 blog posts from here and list them on my readme. This post will outline some of the basic components and provide a link to my repo where the functional source code lives.</p>

<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dxrf.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2021&#x2F;03&#x2F;16&#x2F;nginx-url-rewrites">Rewriting URLs with Nginx</a> 
</p>
<p>In my post &#39;HTTPS for Multiple domains using GitHub pages&#39;, I was originally using a HTML file with a meta redirect. While this technique does work, I discovered a very annoying flaw. Anyone that had an old, or non-ssl link was redirected to the home page instead of the page or post they wanted. This isn&#39;t a delightful experience so I started doing some research to find a better path.</p>
