<a href="https://dxrf.com">GitHub Copilot tab-complete not working in markdown files</a> 
</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been with the beta for GitHub Copilot for a while and I recently noticed that the tab-complete stopped working when editing markdown files. I started searching and found a couple GH issues, one of which has a usable workaround.</p>

<p>
<a href="https://dxrf.com">Setting up Shared Enterprise Actions</a> 
</p>
<p>I recently had a customer that wanted to set up shared runners in their enterprise but the docs weren&#39;t super clear so I wrote up these steps to make it easier.</p>

<p>
<a href="https://dxrf.com">Consuming Jekyll-feed xml with Node.JS and Mustache templates</a> 
</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been spending some free time sprucing up my GitHub personal readme. One of those tasks was to pull the last 5 blog posts from here and list them on my readme. This post will outline some of the basic components and provide a link to my repo where the functional source code lives.</p>

<p>
<a href="https://dxrf.com">Rewriting URLs with Nginx</a> 
</p>
<p>In my post &#39;HTTPS for Multiple domains using GitHub pages&#39;, I was originally using a HTML file with a meta redirect. While this technique does work, I discovered a very annoying flaw. Anyone that had an old, or non-ssl link was redirected to the home page instead of the page or post they wanted. This isn&#39;t a delightful experience so I started doing some research to find a better path.</p>

<p>
<a href="https://dxrf.com">Rego Unit Testing</a> 
</p>
<p>This post is going to outline some basics, interesting tidbits, and caveats on unit testing rego policies.</p>
